Created a Dockerfile and Docker Compose(compose.yaml) file to define the application.

Configured a YAML file(.github>workflows>docker.yml) to build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub.

Installed Minikube for Kubernetes environment setup.

Installed Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.

Deployed the Kubernetes configuration using Minikube.

Configured a provider.tf file for versions and configurations.

Configured K8s.tf file to create a Kubernetes namespace named k8s-ns-by-tf using the kubernetes_namespace resource.

Deployed the application with two replicas in Kubernetes.

Exposed the service manually due to running Docker on Windows Desktop.

Creates a deployment named terraform-devops-assignment in the k8s-ns-by-tf namespace with:
- Pods labeled with test: DevopsAssignment.
- A container using the image kmlparihar14/devops-assignment:latest.
- Resource limits: 0.5 CPU and 512Mi memory.
- Resource requests: 250m CPU and 50Mi memory.

Defines a NodePort service named devops-syvora-service in the same namespace to expose the deployment with:
- Selector matching test: devops-assignment.
- Port and target port set to 3000 with TCP protocol.
- External traffic policy set to Local.
- Optionally allows specifying an exact NodePort.
    
To deploy the backend application in Kubernetes using Helm charts, I first created a Helm chart using the helm create command.
       
Updated the generated Helm files to define services and providers according to the application's requirements.

I deployed the Helm chart using the helm install command.
